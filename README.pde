Brief description of piece:
Predator version of PinBall, with 2 lines as flippers, 2 triangles for the ball to roll on, and 4 objects to score points.

Known bugs/problems:
Ball gets stuck after rolling down on on left or right triangle after left or right flipper and doesn't move, the cause of this bug could not be found.
Had to increase frameRate to 120 for proper functionality of the game, ball was too slow at 60, if increased the speed of the ball this only caused more problems
(ball getting stuck or going beyond line)

Sources used:
Predator image used finding google images.

Key Instructions:
Very simple, use LEFT or RIGHT key to move flippers up, release keys to reset the flippers
